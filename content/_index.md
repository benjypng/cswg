> We are a community of Catholic Social Workers committed to integrating our faith and professional calling. Our Guild’s mission is to reflect God’s love through our service to the Church and society while promoting the spiritual and professional development of our members.

## Vision

A visible sign of God's love in serving.

## Mission

Promote spiritual and professional development of Catholic social workers.

## Our Journey

The idea for our Guild was conceived on September 20, 2019, when a group of Social Workers - Ian Peterson, Melanie Goh-Joshua, Olivia Shepherdson, Karen Chua, Katherine Baptist, and Grace Vaz - came together to pray and contemplate the possibility of forming a group for Catholics who are trained as Social Workers. By God’s grace, they were connected with Christine Wong - then Executive Director of Caritas Singapore, who likewise was thinking about forming such a body. After prayers and discernment, as well as dedication from the Core Committee, the Guild was officially registered as a society by the Registry of Societies on March 9, 2024.

From an initial group of six, we have grown to 80 members who are trained professional Social Workers. We are continually seeking to welcome more Catholic Social Workers into our Guild to journey together as Catholics and grow professionally as Social Workers.

## The Guild

Our Guild encompasses a diverse group of social work professionals from various sectors, including healthcare, education, and community. Over the years, we have conducted prayer sessions, prayer experiences, talks where we share our experiences, support one another, and pray for those we serve.
